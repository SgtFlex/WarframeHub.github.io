	<pre>Welcome to Warframe hub! 
	
	A lot of useful stuff is linked here that is related to warframe, so you dont have to constantly open/close links when looking for stuff, and you have easy
	access to the most useful sites related to Warframe!
	
	FAQ:
	
		Where should I farm x?
			A: War.farm (The formatted table link) is best used to farm stuff in rotations, such as Warframe blueprints, or for
			farming relics. If you can't find either of those on War.farm, then resort to the official drop tables and use Ctrl + F to search.
			Otherwise, use the "Where do I farm x?" button to search for more up-to-date farming locations for
			resources.
	
		Is this site dead?
			A: The last date this site has been updated on was on 11/18/2017.
		
		What's with the URL?
			A: Site is currently under development from an HTML newbie, so I don't want to invest money into a domain quite yet, but
			if it's requested enough, I will do it since I'll see people are using the site besides myself.
		
		Where did you start learning HTML?
			A:W3schools.com! Very useful site, and it walks you through pretty well. If you have any interest in developing your own
			site, I recommend it.
			
		How can I suggest changes?
			A: Easy! Contact me at <u><b>warframehub@gmail.com</b></u> and just let me know what suggestions you have! Suggestions could include
			stuff like useful websites, but stray away from opinions on stuff like "Best builds" and try to keep it factual, such as things
			about where to farm X. Any website that includes some needed utility I will happily include when I can.
		
		Why isn't X website included(Such as Warframe builder)?
			A: Unfortunately, I'm still really new to HTML, and thus I'm still learning how to do all of this stuff, and websites like Warframe
			Builder don't work in this site when linked, so I have to just let it open in a new tab where it will work.
			
		X info/site is out of date.
			A:Please let me know if anything is out of date! I don't want anyone farming or following outdated information hopelessly!
			
		Your site looks/performs like shit
			A: Well thanks, it's to be expected. I know very little at the moment, but my effort to make this great shall continue!
